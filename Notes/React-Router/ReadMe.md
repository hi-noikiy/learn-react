## packages in **react-router**

**react-router v4** uses monorepo archetecture, it contains four packages:

- react-router, which is the core of React Router
- react-router-dom, which is the DOM binding for React-Router
- react-router-native, which is the React-Native binding for React-Router
- react-router-config, which are Static route config helpers

Both **react-router-dom** and **react-router-native** use **react-router** as dependency.

In most case, we use **react-router-dom** as we use react-router in browser enviroment.
