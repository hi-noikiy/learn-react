# Performance optimization in reactjs

**Always care keep an eye on application performance**.

## How to avoid performance problems

### Master common performance scenes

- keyboard input
- mousewheel

### always keep an eye on performance

- Know when to split a component(component splitting granularity)

Pure function component does not participate in **dom-diff**.

- Know when there will be a space to optimize performance

### Focus on code that can be reconstructed

DRY principle. In a real work environment, split code that can be reconstructed by following the **DRY priciples**, and when you have time, you can rebuild a component that could be optimized.

To keep dom operation fluency, the  DOM operations priority is lower than the browser's behavior, such as keyboard input and mouse input. (User intercation first)

### Know how to locate performance problems

- React dev tool
- chrome dev tool

## Network performance optimization

**Webpack** helps you.

- Load resource on demand
- By using **the import API of Webpack**
- By using **react-loadable**, we can implement React component loading asynchronously.

## Optimization performance by reselect

### advandage of reselect

- Selectors can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state.
- Selectors are efficient. A selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes.
- Selectors are composable. They can be used as input to other selectors.

It's similar to the computed properties of **Vue** component.

**reselect** process for creating automatic cached data.

## asynchronous render in react

### Time Slicing

In reactjs, there is a map between the real dom and the virtual dom. Whenever there is a change in virtual dom, reactjs will update change to real dom automatically. So reactjs determines when to update the real dom and how to update the real dom by itself.

### Suspense

The simple definition of the suspense feature is that ReactJS can pause any state update until the data been fetched is ready to be rendered. In essence, ReactJS suspends the component tree while waiting for the data to be fetched completely. During the suspension, it goes ahead to handle other high-priority updates.
