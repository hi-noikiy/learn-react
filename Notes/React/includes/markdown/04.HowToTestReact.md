# How To Test React App

Enzyme is a wrap of React official test tool. It's more convinient than official one.

So there will be two availble method for the same test case in React test.

- Test case write in official test tool

- Enzyme write

## Official test suite

There are two existing way for a React component: virtual dom(Instance of React.Component) and real DOM node. The official test tool of React provides solution two this two type of React component:

- Shallow Rendering: test virtual dom
- Dom Rendering: test real dom

### Shalow Rendering

Shallow rendering lets you render a component “one level deep” and assert facts about what its render method returns, without worrying about the behavior of child components, which are not instantiated or rendered. This does not require a DOM.

An example of test case in official test suite:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import ShallowRenderer from 'react-test-renderer/shallow'

import Todo from './component'

describe('Todo wrapper is div', () => {
  // it is a test case
  it('App\'s title should be Todo', () => {
    const app = shallowRender(Todo)
    expect(app.props.children[0].type).toBe('h1')
  })
})


function shallowRender(Component) {
  const renderer =  ShallowRenderer.createRenderer()
  return renderer.render(<Component />)
}
```
