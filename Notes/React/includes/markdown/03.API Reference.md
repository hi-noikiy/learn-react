## React.Component

How to define React Component class:

```javascript
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>
  }
}
```

### The Component Lifecycle

- forceUpdate

By default, when your component’s state or props change, your component will re-render. If your **render()** method depends on some other data,
you can tell React that the component needs re-rendering by calling **forceUpdate()**.

Normally you should try to avoid all uses of forceUpdate() and only read from this.props and this.state in render().

## ReactDOM

**The react-dom package provides DOM-specific methods** that can be used at the top level of your app and as an escape hatch to get outside of the React model if you need to.
Most of your components should not need to use this module.

- render

- hydrate

```javascript
ReactDOM.hydrate(ele, container, callback)
```

Same as render(), but is used to hydrate a container whose HTML contents were rendered by ReactDOMServer.
React will attempt to attach event listeners to the existing markup.

React expects that the rendered content is identical between the server and the client.

- unmountComponentAtNode

```javascript
ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container)
```

- fndDOMNode

```javascript
ReactDOM.findDOMNode(component)
```

**In most cases, you can attach a ref to the DOM node and avoid using findDOMNode at all.**

## ReactDOMServer

**The ReactDOMServer object enables you to render components to static markup. Typically, it’s used on a Node server:**

```javascript
import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server';
var ReactDOMServer = require('react-dom/server');
```
