# Main Concept

## JSX

JSX is javascript sugar for react. It is recommended being used in React to describe what the UI should look like.
JSX may remind you of template languate, but **it comes with the full power of javascript**.
JSX produces React 'element'.

### Embedding Expressions in JSX

```javascript
const name = 'Josh'
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('app')
)
```

You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX.

### JS is an Expression Too

### Specifying Attributes with JSX

### Specifying Children with JSX

JSX tag may contain children:

```javascript
const element = (
  <div>
    <h1> Hello</h1>
    <h2> Good to see you here</h2>
  </div>
)
```

### JSX Represents Objects

Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.

These two are indentical:

```javascript
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
)
```

```javascript
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
)
```

## Rendering an Element into the DOM

```javascript
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
const ele = <h1>Hello, world<h1>
ReactDOM.render(ele, document.getElementById('root'))
```

## Components and Props

### Functional and class Components

The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:

```javascript
function Welcome (props) {
  return (
    <h1> Hello, {props.name}</h1>
  )
}
```

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “functional” because they are literally JavaScript functions.

You can also use an **ES6 class** to define a component:

```javascript
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return <h1> Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>
  }
}
```

The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.

### Rendering a Component

```javascript
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

The render method will be called each time an update happen.

### Composing Components

### Extracting Components

**DRY** principle for create a component.

### Props are Read-Only

Consider this *sum* function:

```javascript
function sum (a, b) {
  return a + b
}
```

Such functions are called “pure” because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.

In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:

```javascript
function withdraw (account, amount) {
  account.amount -= amount
}
```

React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:
**All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.*

## State and Lifecycle

State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.

The differences bettween a pure function component and a **ES6** class component is that a function component doest not have state.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import './index.scss'

class Tick extends Component {
  // Class components should always call the base constructor with props.
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      date: new Date()
    }
  }
  // render function returns an instance of React class
  render () {
    return (
      <div className="Tick">
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>`It's ${this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}` </h2>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Tick
```

### Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class

The **componentDidMount()** hook runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM.

In react, we use **this.setState()** to update a local state for a component.

If the a component is ever removed from the DOM, React calls the **componentWillUnmount()** lifecycle hook so the timer is stopped.

### Using State Correctly

#### Update state by **setState**

#### State Updates May Be Asynchronous

React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance.

Because this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

Solution:

```javascript
this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
  counter: prevState.counter + props.increment
}));
```

**setState** function accepts a function rather than an object.

### State Updates are Merged

### The Data Flows Down

This is commonly called a “top-down” or “unidirectional” data flow. Any state is always owned by some specific component, and any data or UI derived from that state can only affect components “below” them in the tree.

## Understanding virtual dom and key property

### How virtual dom works

**Virtual dom** is the operation basic for JSx. For react component, it has a virtual dom which maps to real dom. Whenever there is a change on it, it will map the change which based on **DOM diff** to real dom automatically.



## Handling Events

Handling events with React is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntactic difference:

- React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
- With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
- Another difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly.

```javascript
function ActionClick () {
  function handleClick (e) {
    e.preventDefault()
    console.log('The click was clicked!')
  }

  return (
    // this will be undefined withouth bind declaration
    <a href="#" onClick={handleClick.bind(this)}>Click me </a>
  )
}
```

Here, *e* is a synthetic event. React defines these synthetic events according to the W3C spec, so you don’t need to worry about cross-browser compatibility. See the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html">SyntheticEvent</a> reference guide to learn more.</br>

A fully example is <a href="../../src/components/Clock/index.js"> Clock Component</a>

## Conditional Rendering

```javascript
function Greeting (props) {
  const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn
  if (isLoggedIn) {
    return <UserGretting>
  }
  return GuestGreeting
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Greeting isLoggedIn={false} />
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

### Preventing Component from Rendering

In rare cases you might want a component to hide itself event though it was rendered by another component. To do this return **null** instead of its render output.

```javascript
function WarningBanner (props) {
  if (props.warn) {
    return null
  }
  return (
    <div className="warn">
      {this.props.warn}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Lists and keys

### Rendering Multiple Components

### Keys

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. **Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:**

```javascript
class ShoppingList extends Component {
  render () {
    const items = this.props.items || []
    const ListItems = items.map((item, index) => {
      return (
        // Dont use index as a key. Not recomended. This can negatively impact in performance and may cause issues with component state.
        <li key={item.name} className="list-item">
        <ShoppingItem name={item.name} amount={item.amount}/>
        </li>
      )
    })

    return (
      <div className="shoping-list-wrapper">
        <ul className="shopping-list">
          {ListItems}
        </ul>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

**Dont use index as a key. Not recomende. This can negatively impact in performance and may cause issues with component state.**

## Forms

## Lifting State Up

## Composition vs Inheritance

React has a powerful composition model, and we **recommend using composition** instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.

### Containment

- this.props.children

```javascript
const Wrapper = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      {this.props.children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

- props

Both ***Contacts*** and ***Chat** here are object. So we can pass then to children component as a props's property.

```javascript
function SplitPanel(props) {
  return (
    <div className="SplitPane">
      <div className="SplitPane-left">
        {props.left}
      </div>
      <div className="SplitPane-right">
        {props.right}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

function App() {
  return (
    <SplitPanel
      left={
        <Contacts />
      }
      right={
        <Chat />
      } />
  )
}
```

### Specialization

Sometimes we think about components as being “special cases” of other components. For example, we might say that a ***WelcomeDialog*** is a special case of ***Dialog**.

### So what about inheritance

At Facebook, we use React in thousands of components, and we haven’t found any use cases where we would recommend creating component inheritance hierarchies.

If you want to reuse non-UI functionality between components, we suggest extracting it into a separate JavaScript module. The components may import it and use that function, object, or a class, without extending it.

## Thinkging in React

In this chapter, we’ll walk you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table using React.

The **single responsibility principle**, that is, **a component should ideally do one thing**. If it ends up with growing, it should be decomponposed into smaller subcomponents. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
